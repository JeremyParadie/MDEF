## Assignment
> [Week 18 · Invention, Intelectual Property, and Income](https://fablabbcn-projects.gitlab.io/learning/fabacademy-local-docs/course_info/mdef/weeklytasks/#week-18-invention-intelectual-property-and-income)
> - Create a dissemination plan for your final project
> - Outline future possibilities and describe how to make them probabilities
> - Choose a license (open/closed) of your choice for your final mdef intervention

#### Dissemination plan

The plan for dissemination is to eventually [publish the project prototype on GitHub](https://github.com/jeremyparadie/Subatomic-Notes), launching the project publicly. This involves polishing to the point of publishing, and writing up a good readme that explains the project. The source will be available in the GitHub repository, and I'll use GitHub Pages to host it. 

#### Future possibilities

In the future, I'd like to get the rest of the features implemented. It would be great if a community of people looking for the same sort of solution gathered around the project and made contributions, but that would probably require some work from me. I'd want to make a proper website for it with its own domain name, front page, philosophy and development posts, and the web app itself. Also a Discord server would be necessary. People need to know of the project's existence, so maybe posting about the project in online forums and writing articles or a manifesto would help people find the project.

But for this possible future to become a reality, I'd need to get the rest of the basic features implemented so I can prove the concept works, and people have something to work with, and that takes development time, which I don't have right now, but maybe some day. 

#### License

After many hours of research, I have chosen the [MIT license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) for the project because it is simple, open, and common.
