## Reflection

#### Content 
This week we discussed milling circuit boards and soldering: fabrication processes, machines, materials, tools, services, components, assembly, and file formats, among other things.

#### Feelings
This week I felt overwhelmed, gaslit, unsupported, and disappointed. I am scared of being punished for not performing well in this insanity. I can no longer think coherently. I am completely isolated socially, emotionally, academically, and intellectually. I find the culture toxic. I talk to people and they say supportive things but are not interested in actually being supportive. It's probably just me because nobody else seems to feel this way. 

#### Learnings
This week I learned you can use a vinyl cutters to cut traces out of copper tape and use Kapton tape as an insulating layer between the layers of traces. Also both the vinyl cutter and the laser cutter can be used to make solder stencils. There is some open source python software called gerber2graphtec that, if using the Silhouette Cameo, will replace Silhouette Studio, and it significantly increases quality for use making stencils. "This produces stencils usable down to approximately 0.5 mm pitch (QFP/QFN) and 0201 discrete components."

#### Inspiration
I am looking forward to experiment with making multilayer circuits with a vinyl cutter someday. I wonder if anyone tried using gerber2graphtec for cutting circuit board traces?
