## Reflection

#### Project
This week I joined [[Angel Cho|Angel]], [[José Hirmas|José]], and [[Aparna Pallod|Aparna]] with their Biography of Dead Objects project. Here is a link to the [project repository](https://github.com/JeremyParadie/MDEF-Academy-Micro-Challenge-2) where you can find more information about the project.

#### Contribution
My contribution to the project was general support, electronics consulting, and wire strain relief. It took a while for me to join a group. This was because I don't fit in here and I had trouble getting support. I spent a lot of time this week helping other groups. 

#### Evaluation
I think I did well, given the circumstances. Despite the lack of faculty support, I pushed forward anyway and made something work, while providing value to others.

#### Feelings
This week I felt completely overwhelmed and left behind, but most significantly, sad.

#### Learnings
This week I learned that sometimes things just go wrong and it is okay to take a more passive role so I can expend less energy so I can continue to move forward.

#### Inspiration
The severe inadequacies in this program inspire me to make something better someday.
