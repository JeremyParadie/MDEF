## Assignment
> [Week 9 · Molding and Casting](https://fablabbcn-projects.gitlab.io/learning/fabacademy-local-docs/course_info/mdef/weeklytasks/#week-9-molding-and-casting)
> - Make a mold (can be 1 or two sides) HARD-SOFT-HARD . 3DPRINT- CAST SILICONE- CAST SOMETHING INSIDE
> - You can use biomaterials to substitute the silicone or the final cast.


I made a wax casting of a cube with indents in the center of each face. I 3d printed the final shape and superglued it to a dowel which was glued to a piece of plywood. I dissolved agar powder in water and poured it in a square container, and placed the 3d printed part in the center, held in place by the dowel and weighed down from floating by the piece of plywood.

It cured into a solid mass, and I removed it from the container.

Then I cut the agar and pulled it off the 3d printed part, and it broke into 3 pieces, making a 3-part mold.

The 3d printed part softened from the heat of the liquid agar and it warped. The buoyancy caused it to rotate about the mounting point.

Then I slid the mold pieces together and put them back into the square container.

Then I used a spoon to carve a sort of funnel to help the wax flow into the void from the dowel.

Then I melted wax and poured it into the void made from the dowel until it filled the cavity left by the 3d print.

After cooling, I took the agar out of the square container again and separated the mold pieces and to remove the wax casting.

The bottom corner of the pour (the top of the picture above) was rounded, perhaps from an air bubble or some water, but other than that, the agar held its shape well and the layer lines texture from the 3d print are clearly visible on the wax. The wax contracted when it cooled, adding even more warping in comparison to the original design. I had extra wax left over so I filled the mold a second time.

## Reflection

#### Content 
This week we discussed molding types, materials, vendors, additives, processing, and safety, among other things.

#### Feelings
This week I felt sad. I was disappointed that the policy of the fab lab prevents me from making. They were incapable of supporting me in many ways at the same time. Lack of parts, faculty support, machine access bureaucracy, and policies counter to the spirit of the class were significant issues.

#### Learnings
This week I learned that agar is a suitable mold material for casting wax. I had never heard of this combination before, but I thought it might possibly work, and I tried it, and it worked really well. 

#### Inspiration
I am looking forward to molding with continuous carbon fiber composites some day.
