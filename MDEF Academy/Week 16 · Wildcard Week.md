## Assignment
> [Week 16 · Wildcard Week](https://fablabbcn-projects.gitlab.io/learning/fabacademy-local-docs/course_info/mdef/weeklytasks/#week-16-wildcard-week)
> - Design and produce something with a digital fabrication process (incorporating computer-aided design and manufacturing) not covered in another tasks

I designed a cube using the sheet metal features in Onshape, with the plan to cut it out on the vinyl cutter such that the adhesive was exposed only on the tabs and scoring was used to facilitate folding. It was not assembled in a press-fit way like in other tasks. This was the first time I used sheet metal features in a CAD program, which automatically accounts for the thickness of the material.

## Reflection

#### Content 
This week we discussed other digital fabrication processes, machines, welding, molding, casting, folding, robotics, electronics, embedded programming, food, materials, biotechnology, textiles, and composites, among other things.

#### Feelings
This week I felt jaded.

#### Learnings
This week I learned that a bleeder and breather layer can help facilitate the removal of excess resin in a compressed composite layup process.

#### Inspiration
It would be really cool to do 3d light painting with a robotic arm while the camera is mounted to a second robotic arm that moves slightly every frame.
