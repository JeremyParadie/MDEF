## Assignment
> [Week 1 ¬∑ Principles, Practices, and Project Management](https://fablabbcn-projects.gitlab.io/learning/fabacademy-local-docs/course_info/mdef/weeklytasks/#week-1-principles-and-practices-project-management)
> - Update your webpage with: A new section for FabAcademy, a post/page for each topic and a post/page for each Challenge
> - Send a profile picture from you or anything represents yourself
> - Browse through the fabacademy web pages of last year MDEF students, select 3 examples of documentation (from weekly tasks) that you find most interesting. Explain why and try to identify the key points.

I updated the website with sections for MDEF Academy and the challenges.

I sent my profile picture.

I found 3 examples of documentation from last year's students that were interesting:
	- [Cl√©ment's](https://clement_rames.gitlab.io/mdef-website/fabacademy.html) was nice because the weekly posts were descriptive, short, and to the point, with pictures depicting the project. I liked that it was all in one page.
	- [Morgane's](https://morgane_shaban.gitlab.io/mdef/fabacademy.html) was nice because it was descriptive and straightforward. The initial questions and final questions were interesting.
	- [Josefina's](https://josefina_nano.gitlab.io/mdef-website/fabacademy12.html) was interestingly broken down into facts, feelings, findings, and future, with all posts in one page. I liked this approach to documentation.

## Reflection

#### Content 
This week we discussed the fabacademy schedule, version control, web development, documentation, and project management software, among other things.

#### Feelings
This week I felt bored with the familiar technical information and very overwhelmed with the new logistics information. The calendar was incorrect and the poor quality of the audio system made it frustratingly difficult to understand what was said in the hall. Luckily I was able to put earbuds in and connect to zoom. 

#### Learnings
This week I was reintroduced to git and static websites. Seeing the previous year's websites was helpful in gaining an understanding of the expectations.

#### Inspiration
I am looking forward to having a completed website someday. The links in the [global project management lecture](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/project_management/index.html) included some content management systems that I might want to go through on my quest to augment my mental capacities with software tools.
