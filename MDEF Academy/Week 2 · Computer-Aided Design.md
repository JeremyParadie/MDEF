## Assignment
> [Week 2 · Computer-Aided Design](https://fablabbcn-projects.gitlab.io/learning/fabacademy-local-docs/course_info/mdef/weeklytasks/#week-2-computer-aided-design)
> - Design and create a 3d model with some relation to each person’s research project. The result must be uploaded to the website in a rendered format.
> - Setting up context over the render of the 3D model using some 2D design software, the accounted context could be a poster that combines the render as collage or other 2D or 3D tools vectorial or raster compositions as you wish. There should be some vectorial and raster drawings on the render. The modeling tools of use are completely open to your skills but we encourage you test softwares that you never used.

I designed a 3d model in Grasshopper. The model represents my research project: It is messy and things are everywhere and there is an attempt to connect things together but it is not efficient. This was my first time using grasshopper to generate 3d geometry. 

Grasshopper components:

First I saved an SVG of the wireframe. I accidentally exported it as portrait so I fixed it in LibreOffice Draw.

Then I made a Blender render. This was my first time using Blender to make a render.

Then I realized that Rhino has a rendering feature. I tried that.

Then I created a drawing in Rhino with the top, front, side, orthographic and isometric projections. I exported as SVG but it had strange line widths so I fixed it in LibreOffice Draw.

## Reflection

#### Content 
This week we discussed how to make designs on a computer: 2D, 3D, raster, vector, programs, and file formats, among other things.

#### Feelings
This week I felt frustrated when the lectures went too deep into technical information about how to use the software without a hands-on walkthrough where we actually use the software. The majority of the information was lost on me.

#### Learnings
This week I learned that FreeCAD and Blender both have python scripting built-in, which is quite significant. I also got much more familiar with grasshopper and blender.

#### Inspiration
Some day I'd like to play around with GPU-accelerated voxel-based CAD and CAM.
