## Reflection

#### Project
This week I developed the first proof-of-concept for Subatomic Notes, an experimental prototype tool for mapping highly networked thoughts. Here is a link to the [project repository](https://github.com/JeremyParadie/MDEF-Academy-Micro-Challenge-4) where you can find more information about the project.

#### Contribution
My contribution was the entire project; I was the only person in my group. This was definitely the right decision. It was difficult to find anyone with mutual or even adjacent interests, perhaps because my interests are obscure and unusual to designers. 

#### Evaluation
I think I did very well. I worked on something directly applicable to my final project, I learned new stuff in the process, and I had something meaningful to demonstrate at the end of the week. 

#### Feelings
In the beginning of the week I felt bad all-around. But as the week went on, I figured out what I was doing and actually made a lot of progress on everything, which felt good to finally do. 

#### Learnings
This week I got more familiar with the basics of web development with javascript. I also learned about the history of [[Ted Nelson]]'s Xanadu project. He and I have  similar visions for how we wish computers could work for us, but very different approaches to implementation. Luckily for me, processing power should be less of a bottleneck. 

#### Inspiration
I am looking forward to continuing the project by adding missing features, including the ability for user data to be saved to a decentralized database.
