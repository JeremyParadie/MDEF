## Reflection

#### Project
This week I joined [[Chris Ernst|Chris]] with his web crawler and GPT-3 story generator. Here is a link to the [project repository](https://github.com/JeremyParadie/MDEF-Academy-Micro-Challenge-3) where you can find more information about the project.

#### Contribution
My contribution to the project was the hardware development, as well as general software development guidance. I set up the raspberry pi, figured out the workflows and run environment for it, wired up the thermal printer, and figured out what was necessary to get the thermal printer working. 

#### Evaluation
I think I did well. I wasn't particularly interested in the project, but I pushed through that and did some things I'd never done before, with an acceptable output. 

#### Feelings
It was nice to do a mini-hackathon with a friend.

#### Learnings
This was the first time I set up a Raspberry Pi in a headless configuration, and it was the first time I'd developed on a Linux computer via SSH. It was also the first time I used Git for managing versions between software developers. 

#### Inspiration
I am looking forward to working on something more related to my project in the next micro challenge.
