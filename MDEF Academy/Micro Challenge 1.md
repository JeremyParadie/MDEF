## Reflection

#### Project
I was interested in flexures as an inexpensive alternative to precision linear rails in machine tools. This video had me interested [XY HiPER NaP - YouTube](https://youtu.be/AJ7IHvOEr2o?t=15). I had no experience with flexures, so, with [[Santi Fuentemilla|Santi]]'s approval, I decided to model a bunch of different flexure configurations to be cut with a laser to provide me some intuition for how the parameters effect flexure performance. Here is a link to the [project repository](https://github.com/JeremyParadie/MDEF-Academy-Micro-Challenge-1) where you can find more information about the project.

#### Contribution
My contribution was the entire project; I was the only person in my group. 

#### Evaluation
I think I did well. I found something I was interested in and I made it work, despite difficulties.

#### Feelings
This week I felt awful and I wanted to cry. I don't understand what is going on, but I know that I don't fit in. I am confused and frustrated. There is not enough time. 

#### Learnings
This week I learned how to use configurations in Onshape, and I learned how to do parametric text generation as labels for the parts. This week was the first time I attempted Finite Element Analysis, but the software was quite limited.

#### Inspiration
I am looking forward to finally cutting out the designs and gaining an intuition for flexures.
