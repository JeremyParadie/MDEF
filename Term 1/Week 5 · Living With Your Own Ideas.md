## Reflection

This week gave me an opportunity to disrupt the way I was doing things to try of something else works better. I think it was helpful. Very confusing, but helpful.

-   _What did you make? And why did it matter?_ I made a video. And I went for a walk. But it really wasn't about the walk. Or the video. It was about sitting with my anxiety and trying some new social interactions, specifically expressing in detail how I feel and then responding to my feelings as if I am a third person helping a friend. This was effective at providing a different perspective. Ironically my first person perspective activity was to take a third person perspective of my situation, which was helpful. So, I'm not sure what the significance of that is in the context of [Oscar Tomico](app://obsidian.md/Oscar%20Tomico)'s narrative.
-   _What happens when you involve yourself?_ Or when I involve others? Involving others in my situation is helpful in ways that I can't be helpful to myself on my own. Although I tried to do this by becoming a third person and as a result was successful in getting through the activity. When I involve myself in my anxiety, everything usually gets worse.
-   _What happens when you use yourself as an instrument?_ Tools often wear out, break, and need to be fixed or replaced. So using myself as an instrument is a bit risky and requires recovery. Although as a tool I am very versatile and capable of completing complex tasks. When in the presence of others the outcomes are unpredictable because there are factors that are not known to me.
-   _Did anything change about your way of working?_ Yes. I gained a strategy and procedure for contextualizing my anxiety.
-   _What does it mean for your future work?_ I have another tool in my toolbox. I can proceed with a clearer context.
-   _After seeing the videos of your collective, how does it change your understanding of it, present new opportunities or inspire new possibilities for collaboration?_ Seeing other's projects has been helpful in formulating my next [First person perspective](app://obsidian.md/First%20person%20perspective) prototype experiment - this time with a first person perspective in a new external environment.
