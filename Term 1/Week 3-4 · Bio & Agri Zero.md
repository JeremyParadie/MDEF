## Hypothetical Designed Organism Description
My futuristic mutant will make it easier to sort plastic types for recycling. The idea is to spray mutant bacteria as a biofilm on an unknown plastic, which will sense the type of plastic, either by binding and activating proteins on the surface of the cells, or some adsorption mechanic to the plastic, which, through some sort of protein pathway, activates florescent proteins, with different colored florescent proteins associated with different types of plastic. By shining an ultraviolet light on the biofilm, it will glow with a color that indicates the type of plastic, which makes it easy to sort for recycling. 

Gene selected
A database of florescent proteins can be found here https://www.fpbase.org/chart/ 
Sandercyanin is a florescent protein that absorbs ultraviolet light (max excitation at 375nm) and emits red light (max emission at 675nm) This red color is not particularly bright compared to other flourescent proteins, but the particularly large difference beween excitation and emission wavelengths lends well to automated detection with common red/infrared sensitive cameras with UV filters.  Also, it requires the cofactor biliverdin for fluorescence which might lend well to use as a biosensor as there is a known mechanism for activation. Through research, mutations of this protein may be found for how to create variants that fluoresce in different colors other than red.

## Research Paper Synopsis
https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.1525622113

The North American walleye is turning from yellow to blue. It is theorized that this color change is in response to increased UV radiation from a depletion of UV-absorbing ozone in the atmosphere above their northern habitat, caused by human activity. The chemical complex that causes the blue appearance, called Sandercyanin, is made of two components: a protein, and a pigment called Biliverdin, which is created when heme is broken down by UV radiation. 4 of each of these two components come together in a loop to form one Sandercyanin complex, which appears blue, absorbs UV light, and glows red. 

The gene was isolated, cloned, and expressed in E-coli. Details of the molecular structures, binding dynamics, variations, and their spectral properties and mechanism were discussed. Experiments in different environments were conducted. Comparisons were made to other known florescent proteins in the literature. Future research intentions were stated.
