## My fight poster 

This poster is a response to the question "What's your fight?" At this point, I'm fighting to make sense of all the swirling ideas that have been in my head. I'm trying to get some of these ideas to marinate and to coalesce into something useful. The pandemic's isolation has demonstrated my need to bounce ideas off other people, and I hope with the support of the MDEF community I can produce something that sticks.

## Reflection
Wow. The past few weeks have been quite an adjustment. I'm still getting used to living in a city. On my own. In Spain. With social anxiety. This whole thing is kind of crazy. I moved my life to a foreign country where they speak a different language and I don't know anyone and I've been guided only by my blind trust in the MDEF program, which I am really excited about. 

I've had trouble thinking about myself in terms of [[Skills, Knowledge, and Attitude]]. I feel like identity is so much more than this, so much so that using the word identity to refer to [[Skills, Knowledge, and Attitude]] doesn't make sense to me. It feels icky. This framework feels like it is completely missing the essence of me. I don't know. 

I see how approaching each week with a professional identity development goal could be useful, but only if specific steps are implemented to achieve that goal, which we didn't lay out. The whole thing seems utterly pointless because we don't have any significant understanding or agency over the curriculum of each week from which we would presumably achieve these goals. 
Even if we completely hijacked the curriculum of each week to achieve the weekly professional identity development goal, how are we supposed to know which steps will lead to the emergence of specific identity traits if we have not already gained those traits? 
It seems to me that identity is an emergent property based on experiences within oneself, and while we can make guesses, I don't understand how the emergence of these specific traits could possibly be determined beforehand without extensive study of such an emergent system. I've experienced attempts to influence identity before, and it is really tricky and potentially dangerous- filled with trial and error and potential setbacks that can backfire significantly. 

Perhaps I am taking the identity component of this exercise too literally. Perhaps I see this topic as far more complex than what is presented. It does seem like a bootcamp though, in the sense that identity is influenced and put to the test.

## Feedback

It was a lot of information all at once, and having just arrived in Barcelona, I was unable to absorb everything. I found a lot of what [[Oscar Tomico|Oscar]] said to be too abstract and the examples that [[Mariana Quintero|Mariana]] provided were very helpful to provide grounding and context.
