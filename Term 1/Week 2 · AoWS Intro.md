## Reflection

I thought that the AoWS cards were cool, although I again had trouble with the framework that was presented. Firstly, I missed the history of how these cards came to be. I found this [The-Atlas-of-Weak-Signals](https://fablabbcn.github.io/The-Atlas-of-Weak-Signals/) Which seems like it might have been a student project. If this is the case, credit to them would have been helpful as context for what MDEF students do. Next, there were three types of cards. I still have trouble understanding what their types are useful for. What is a "random trigger" exactly? trigger for what? I do understand "areas of opportunity" although each individual card should say "area" not "areas". And then the other set, which have 5 themes- some are verbs, and some are nouns, which I find extremely distracting, which makes them hard to work with. They should all be of the same part-of-speech. What is the significance of each set?

My understanding is that these are weak signals in the sense that they are things that exist in society today that have the potential to be significant factors in the future. This makes sense. But I couldn't help but notice that
none of the cards presented have a negative connotation. They are all positive or neutral. I think there are many "weak signals" that are scary and will grow to be significant factors in some futures. Why are those excluded from the discussion?

It would have been great if we could search Miro for the cards, but since most of them are images, that didn't work.

I was generally fairly comfortable with the cards, as I've been thinking about many of these concepts over the past year during the pandemic. There were a few that were new to me, which I learned about and added to my mental map. 

Although a bit overwhelming, the cards were a refreshing way to start to grapple with how all these ideas swirling in my head are related.

I am not a fan of miro, which is a bit strange because I like mind mapping and graphic organizers. I find its user interface a bit frustrating to work with and lacking necessary features. I don't seem to think in terms that are easily expressible in miro. This might be an innate property of how I think, or perhaps I just have not figured it out yet. Maybe I find miro to be too messy. I'm not sure. The lag is particularly frustrating, but I do see a massive benefit to free-form connecting of ideas in a medium that is continuous across all students.  I think miro was an acceptable tool to use in this context. The worst part, though, is that I don't trust my work in miro to not be lost because there is no version control or history.

## Design space

![[Pasted image 20211017212915.png]]
My design space was inadvertently corrupted, including my multiscalar diagram. This is really unfortunate, and is what triggered me to fall behind and into dispair with miro. I struggled to find the motivation to rebuild when it could all disappear again without notice. 

The weak signal cards I was working with were a reflection of the ideas in my fight poster starting to come together and coalesce. The cards I chose were the ones most relevant to what I want to do with my project and how that might relate to my fight. 


![[Pasted image 20220111014541.png]]
I found the collective design spaces to be messy and disorganized to the point that I struggle to get any meaning from the collection of notes. It is too easy to add a note and to difficult to organize and link them in a way that brings useful results. I wonder if activities with specific note structures and organization as an [[artistic constraint]] would be more fruitful. 

Reflect on your experience looking for weak signals in a situated approach though scales.



How was the experience of finding points of resonance with others? 
I didn't, really. I found common ground, but certainly not many points of resonance. as a result of miro. there was some resonance in discussion, however, The miro component of the activity seemed superficial as a result - I felt like i engaged with miro the minimum to get the asignment done, I much preferred verbal discussion. 
good. I wish we could spend a lot more time on this.


Next steps - Based on the work this week please tell me:

Someone who runs the fab lab. I want to know all about the fab foundation, all the people who work at the fab lab, and how fab labs are deployed.

An experiment you’d like to make
make a self-replicating organization

A new skill you’d like to add to your personal development plan
? better mental health is not a skill
