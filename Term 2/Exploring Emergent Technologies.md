# Remixing Materials

##### Material Properties
> _Analyze material properties - technical, functional and emotional. Do it with 3 diverse materials you can find around._

| circular       | textured      | dull       |

##### Make a Bioplastic
> _Develop and document your own exploration of one bioplastic recipe._ 

I made a composite of agar and paper towels. I was interested in how stiff the resulting material might be. For this reason I didn't add any glycerine. I didn't know what I was doing and made it up as I went. I tried 3 times. the following procedure was the most sucessful.

Procedure:
1. I added very hot water to dry agar powder. 
2. I mixed it with a spoon. This dissolved the agar powder into a thick fluid.
3. I poured the agar fluid into a rectangluar container.
4. I folded a new paper towel in half and laid it in the rectangular container.
5. I used the spoon to spread the fluid over the paper towel, making sure it became saturated.
6. I folded another new paper towel in half and laid it on top of the other saturated paper towels.
7. I repeated step 5 and 6 until the agar cooled and started to thicken.
8. I applied pressure to the layers of paper towels, squeezing out excess agar fluid.
9. I removed the agar-impregnated paper towels and hung them on the clothesline to dry for a few days.

##### Properties and Applications
> _Analyze properties of your exploration and explain possible applications_

After drying, I am surprised at the rigidity of the result. It is hard and is mechanically comparable to plywood. It is not flat, and the edges are thinner and flexible, but I was planning to cut the edges off anyway. Knocking on it with force hurts my knuckles. It flexes only minimally and resists bending when attempting to bend it with two hands. It could be used as a replacement for MDF, as is has very similar properties.
