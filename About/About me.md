[My Website](https://www.jeremyparadie.com/)

I like to make stuff. I'm from Massachusetts in the United States. My Bachelor's degree is from UMass Amherst where I focused on Creative Mechatronics.

I have wide interdisciplinary interests. I've worked on making makerspaces, making interactive walkways, making a robotic squirrel for behavior research, and making machines that make machines that make things. I am interested in how I can make things that won't be able to be used to exploit people when they are released into the world. I have a strong interest in democratizing the means to make, shifting educational paradigms, and emergent systems. I am concerned about our trajectory into the future. I've got [[MDEF Topics of Interest|a lot of ideas]], and I'd like to combine them to make some sort of positive social impact.
